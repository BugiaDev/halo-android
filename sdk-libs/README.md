### What is this repository for? ###
Contains the library plugins that works with HALO for different tasks. The current libraries are:

- Halo Presenter: A library to use the MVP pattern with Android ensuring that HALO is ready when you receive the callback. It also supports not using Halo just as a plain MVP library.
- Halo Translations: requires the content plugin (now included with the SDK) and allows to automatically cache a language into the local database and display it as content. It uses a module to display this data. Check the wiki for further usage.
